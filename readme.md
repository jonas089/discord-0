Welcome to the Session-bot ( by Jonas )
The session bot will hopefully help us organize Gaming-sessions on this server.
You can already propose gaming sessions and people can join them.

# Supported Commands:
 !view - show open gaming sessions \
 !propose - propose a new gaming session to the group \
 !edit - edit your gaming session \
 !join - join another members gaming session \
 !delete - delete your gaming session \
 ## Examples
 !propose League-of-Legends 15.11.2022 16:30 \
 !edit <id> League-of-Legends 16.11.2022 17:30 \
 !delete <id>  \
 !join <id> \
 !me
 ## Notes
 Bot is under development and may be instable. \
 Spaces can break the bot, e.g. \
 !propose **GTA V** 22.10.2022 16:30 **will look bad**. \
 !propose **GTAV** 22.10.2022 16:30 **will look okay**.
